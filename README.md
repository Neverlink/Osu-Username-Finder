# Osu-Username-Finder
Simple tool which gives you a list of available osu! usernames that fit a certain criteria. (Also my first solo project!)

Please note that any "available username" could be in possession of a restricted user and therefore unable to use.
An error seems to be thrown when a user has never played osu! standard. All I've checked are in fact available.

Use this to check! https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/32
